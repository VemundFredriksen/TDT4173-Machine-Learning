# TDT4173-Machine-Learning
**SVM, Logical Regression, Deep Learning, Case Based Reasoning, kNN**

TDT4173 Machine Learning Course at NTNU. The course focuses on self learning algorithms from different paradigms.


## Assignment 1
Assignment with focus on basic theory about machine learning. Code exercise contains implementation of linear and logistic regression.

## Assignment 2
Read essay about residual layers in deep neural networks. The assignment was to evaluate the paper and write an essay about it.

## Assignment 3
In this assignment the students were to choose 3 out of 6 programming exercises to implement. In this repository 2 of the neural network exercises and 1 k-nearest-neighbour was selected. The nerual network part implements a written-from-scracth deep neural network which should in theory be able to take any data input and learn based in 1-hot-encoded results.

## Assignment 4
This assignment is mainly about case based reasoning. The 'coding' exercise was about using a CBR tool for creating the Case Base and later create queries towards the case base based on the selected similaritiy measures.

## Assignment 5
This assignment was about using the ML framework sk_learn with python to create a character classifier and character detection model. In this repository the model was implemented using a neural network, whereas the detection model used a sliding window mechanism to detect the characters.
